From chatGPT - further steps after standalone
The error you're encountering seems related to a missing table in the Airflow metadata database. Here are a few steps you can take to address this issue:

1. **Initialize Airflow Metadata Database:**
   - Run the following command to initialize the Airflow metadata database:
     ```bash
     airflow db init
     ```

2. **Create a User:**
   - The warning "No user yet created, use flask fab command to do it" suggests that there's no user in the database. Run the following command to create an initial user:
     ```bash
     airflow users create --username admin --firstname <your_firstname> --lastname <your_lastname> --role Admin --email <your_email>
     ```
     Replace `<your_firstname>`, `<your_lastname>`, and `<your_email>` with your actual information.

3. **Re-run the Webserver:**
   - After initializing the database and creating a user, try running the webserver again:
     ```bash
     airflow webserver
     ```

4. **Access the Web UI:**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should be prompted to log in with the user credentials you just created.

This should resolve the issue related to the missing "session" table. If you encounter any other errors, please check the Airflow documentation and community forums for specific solutions related to your environment or setup.
